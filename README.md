## Hello World!

I like making little play environments for myself in Unity as I learn. Currently I'm working on some cool custom unity render pipeline things :)

### Progress So Far
- Worked through most of catlikecoding's [Custom-SRP tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/custom-srp/)
- Created my own lighting shaders following the inspiration of [t3ssel8r's popular videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xJqzUHJ2fI&t=1s&ab_channel=t3ssel8r) (stylistic volumetric-esque lights that can be attached to particles)
- Converted SRP to use deferred shading techniques
- Added additional render passes to detect edges/convexity/outlines with some non-maxima suppression

### Coming Soon ðŸ‘€
- [ ]  Create some progress videos
- [ ]  Grass!
- [ ]  Proper shadows for particle lights
- [ ]  Attach custom render pipeline to other game projects of mine
